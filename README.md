# scLR-isoform-analysis
This repository contains the analysis scripts for **Chapter 3 of my PhD thesis**.  
The analyses presented here were used to identify **cell–type–specific isoforms** from **Oxford Nanopore long-read 10x single-cell data** and benchmark against the results obtained from **PacBio 10x single-cell data**.
